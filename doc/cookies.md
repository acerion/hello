==================
 Cookies in Dillo
==================

The current specification for cookies is RFC 6265
( http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265 ).

Cookies are handled by a dpi (plugin) which shares them between your
instances of Dillo.

Current cookie limits are: 20 per domain, and 1200 in total.

When the dpi exits, cookies that you have ACCEPTed are saved to
~/.dillo/cookies.txt, and ACCEPT_SESSION cookies are forgotten.
The dpi normally exits after a period of inactivity, but you can force it to
exit with the command "dpidc stop".


=====================
 Controlling cookies
=====================

Out of the box, the browser rejects all cookies.

If you want to accept certain cookies, you can specify rules for different
domains in the file ~/.config/.hello/cookiesrc. The syntax looks like:

#host (domain)     action
DEFAULT            DENY
fltk.org           ACCEPT
.host.com          ACCEPT_SESSION

Line 0: Comment line begins with '#'.
Line 1: Deny all cookies from all domains not otherwise specified.
Line 2: Accept all cookies from fltk.org, and save them to
        ~/.dillo/cookies.txt when the cookies dpi exits.
Line 3: So called "dot rule", where domain starts with a dot. Accept all
        cookies from all subdomains of host.com, but do not save them when
        the dpi exits.
        Only subdomains of "host.com" (e.g. "www.host.com") are a match for
        this rule, but the main domain ("host.com") is not. If you want to
        have a rule for "host.com" domain itself, you have to add explicit
        rule for this domain to the config file.

If the file does not exist, it is created by the program with single rule:
DEFAULT DENY

Rules for the config file:

1. The program does not care about case of strings in this file, but for
   historical reasons ("this is how dillo did it") the default rule is
   upper-case.
2. Config file lines with two tokens are accepted for further parsing. Token
   separators are either space or tab characters or mix of these characters.
3. Empty lines are discarded.
4. Comment lines are discarded.
5. Comments can occur only in their own lines. Adding comments afer
   domain/action string results in discarding of entire line.
6. Lines with one, three or more tokens are discarded. If such line contained
   a valid domain, the domain is discarded, and default global action will be
   used for that domain.
7. Lines with malformed action strings (e.g. "DEN", "ACC_EPT", "OK",
   "ALLOW"), are discarded. Mixed-case action string (e.g. "Deny" or
   "AccePT") is not considered to be malformed.

The program stores the rules in a container. The rules must be stored as
ordered by domain length, with longest first, so the first match is the most
specific.

Domains stored in the container are always lower-case.

Domains passed to module's "lookup" function are always forced to lower-case
before action lookup takes place.


===================
 Cookies & Privacy
===================

 Cookies can be a severe threat to personal privacy. The pages you
visit can be tracked, logged, and associated to a peronal data-record,
allowing the possibility of building a detailed profile of your
browsing habits.

 This data is sold to companies that profit from direct use of such
information (SPAM, Spying, etc).

 If this data is cross-referenced with other databases, they can end up
with more information than you have about yourself.

 Some people may tell you this is "paranoid". But please, take my words
as those of someone who has written a web browser, a cookies implementation,
and who has deep understanding of HTTP and cookies.

 The dillo project is especially concerned about privacy and security
issues. Our advice is to avoid cookies whenever possible and at most set
ACCEPT_SESSION to specific, trusted sites.  -- You have been warned.
