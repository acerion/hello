-- Caller has a big buffer with remainder of html document (which can be
-- huge), and also has a length of sub-area/prefix in this big buffer (the

-- should be parsed.

-- Pass the pointer to the big buffer, and a size of this prefix to this

-- This function encodes iso code value, length of entity and (in future)
-- error code in one single returned integer. In original code the length and
-- error code were returned by function arugments (pointers). I don't want to
-- put too much work in doing this in similar way in FFI code, because sooner
-- or later the FFI code will be removed (replaced with "pure" Haskell code).
