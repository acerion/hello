From Dillo code:

"
Handle DOCTYPE declaration

Follows the convention that HTML 4.01 doctypes which include a full w3c DTD
url are treated as standards-compliant, but 4.01 without the url and HTML 4.0
and earlier are not. XHTML doctypes are always standards-compliant whether or
not an url is present.

Note: I'm not sure about this convention. The W3C validator recognizes the
"HTML Level" with or without the URL. The convention comes from mozilla (see
URLs below), but Dillo doesn't have the same rendering modes, so it may be
better to chose another behaviour. --Jcid

http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/quirks/doctypes.html

http://lists.dillo.org/pipermail/dillo-dev/2004-October/002300.html

This is not a full DOCTYPE parser, just enough for what Dillo uses.
