The goal of this project is to allow me to learn Haskell by re-implementing
(small parts of) web browser.




This project is based on Dillo web browser (dillo.org,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo), version 3.0.5.




This project is not using Haskell tool X or Haskell library Y because these
are not the things that I want to focus on right now. My main focus is on
learning the core language and its features (hopefully more and more advanced
features). Examples of X and Y are stack/cabal or a parsing library.




Currently (August 2022) the project is hosted on GitHub:
