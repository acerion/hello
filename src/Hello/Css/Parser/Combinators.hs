{-
Helpers for new approach to parsing of shortcut properties.

The helpers will allow me to rewrite specification of CSS property values
(e.g. "[ [ <'font-style'> || <'font-variant'> || <'font-weight'> ]? ]") in
terms of Haskell.

Poor man's implementation of:
https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#component-combinators
https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#component-multipliers

Also a busy man's implementation, because I don't have time to read through
the CSS spec end-to-end and recognize all usage cases, corner cases, rules
and exceptions.
