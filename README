The goal of this project is to allow me to learn Haskell by re-implementing
(small parts of) web browser.




This project is based on Dillo web browser (dillo.org,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillo), version 3.0.5.




This project is not using Haskell tool X or Haskell library Y because these
are not the things that I want to focus on right now. My main focus is on
learning the core language and its features (hopefully more and more advanced
features). Examples of X and Y are stack/cabal or a parsing library.

A memory may be leaking in FFI code. The boundary between C code and Haskell
is slowly but constantly shifting, so I'm not paying too much attention to
lifetime of objects allocated in FFI code.




Quality of SSL in this program is unknown (internally it is described as
"ALPHA"). Don't rely on quality of SSL in this program.




Currently (January 2023) the project is hosted on GitHub:
https://github.com/acerion/hello.




Compile-time dependencies include:
libssl-dev
libpng-dev
libjpeg-dev
libfltk1.3-dev
ghc version 8.8.4




Compile, install and run with these commands:
export hello_rootdir=hello_rootdir
./configure --prefix=$HOME/$hello_rootdir
make
make install prefix=$HOME/$hello_rootdir
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/$hello_rootdir/lib ~/$hello_rootdir/bin/hello
